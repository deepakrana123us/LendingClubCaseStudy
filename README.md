Project Name: Lending Case Study



*Brief description about the project.
This project aims to leverage data analysis to identify risky loan applicants within an online loan marketplace. 
By examining various factors—including demographics, credit history, loan characteristics, and economic indicators
We will utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to reveal patterns associated with loan defaults. 


The insights gained will enable the company to reduce credit loss, refine lending criteria, and improve the overall loan approval process. Ultimately, this initiative will enhance risk management practices and foster a more profitable lending environment.
