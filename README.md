Brief description about the project.

This project aims to leverage data analysis to identify risky loan applicants within an online loan marketplace. 

By examining various factors—including demographics, credit history, loan characteristics, and economic indicators

We will utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to reveal patterns associated with loan defaults. 


The insights gained will enable the company to reduce credit loss, refine lending criteria, and improve the overall loan approval process. Ultimately, this initiative will enhance risk management practices and foster a more profitable lending environment.

1.	Credit Data Analysis: Data Analysis: Review, Analyse, Cleansing and Normalizing the Historical Credit Data
2.	Create Analytics Model

3.	Proposed solution on 
1.	Identify Risky Borrowers: Use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover characteristics of defaulters.
2.	Reduce Credit Loss: Minimize loans to high-risk applicants to lower financial losses.
3.	Enhance Portfolio Management: Refine lending criteria based on EDA insights.
4.	Improve Approval Processes: Implement data-driven decisions for more accurate loan approvals.
5.	Strengthen Customer Segmentation: Tailor products and marketing strategies based on borrower risk profiles.
6.	Monitor Performance Metrics: Establish KPIs to evaluate the success of risk management efforts.

4.	Key Driver Variables to Investigate
1.	Demographics: Age, income, employment, education.
2.	Credit History: Credit score, payment history, bankruptcies.
3.	Loan Characteristics: Amount, interest rate, term, purpose.
4.	Economic Indicators: Unemployment rates and regional performance.
5.	Behavioural Factors: Transaction history and spending habits.
6.	Application Details: Application completion time and inquiries made.

## Business Problem trying to solve
	The project aims to address the significant issue of credit loss resulting from loan defaults. In the lending industry, particularly within online loan marketplaces, identifying borrowers who are likely to default is critical for maintaining financial health and minimizing losses.
Key aspects of the problem include:
1.	High Default Rates: Many borrowers labelled as 'charged-off' lead to substantial financial losses for lenders. Understanding the characteristics and behaviours that indicate a higher likelihood of default is essential.
2.	Inefficient Loan Approval Processes: Current lending practices may not adequately account for the risk factors associated with borrowers, leading to misguided approvals and increased exposure to defaults.
3.	Lack of Data-Driven Insights: Without thorough data analysis, it is challenging to establish effective criteria for evaluating borrower risk. This lack of insight can hinder the company’s ability to optimize its loan offerings and customer segmentation.
4.	Impact on Profitability: Credit losses directly affect the bottom line. Reducing the number of high-risk loans can improve overall profitability and sustainability for the business.
	By solving this problem, the project aims to enhance risk assessment strategies, reduce credit loss, and ultimately improve the company’s financial performance and customer experience
